Suggestion: read carefully the GitHub Action output. It might contain information that might help fixing the problem. If not please keep opening the bug report.

The documentation might have information on what you could do to fix the problem.

**Copy-paste the output of the GitHub Action**

Full output might contain useful information including the git command, git output and settings used. It also helps to search for the problem later on.

**URL to the execution**

Paste the URL of the execution where it's possible to see the problem. This will help me to see the configuration and the output in more context.
